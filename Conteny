"There is no Jasypt utility available in the Orchestra framework, unlike in the UF framework. Therefore, for the stories we are working on, the actual passwords are required in the local file. However, we are not committing passwords to the `application-local.yml` file. The Orchestra team recommends passing passwords as JVM arguments when running the application locally. Alternatively, we can implement Jasypt by adding the required dependency and placing the encrypted passwords in the `application-local.yml` file."
