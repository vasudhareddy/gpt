- After deploying the changes, I observed jobs running more than once:
  - One instance at 1 AM.
  - Another instance at 10:17 AM.
- This issue is due to a fixed delay in the scheduled task.
  - To address this, I removed the task to ensure the job runs only once.
- Additional observation:
  - The cron job is executing on all PCF instances.
  - I added code to ensure the job runs only once on a single instance.
- Intermittent reconnecting issues are observed occasionally:
  - Likely due to server load or network instability.
- With 10-15 services loading data into Redis simultaneously, there may be an overload.
  - Suggestion: Stagger jobs to reduce load, e.g., some at 1 AM, others at 2 AM, etc.
