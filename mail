 hope you're doing well. I wanted to inform you about the recent URL migration work that I completed. While reviewing the changes, I realized that I mistakenly assumed that only one component required updates. However, I discovered that there are additional components (2-3) that also need similar changes, which I unfortunately missed in the initial migration.

I sincerely apologize for this oversight. I want to ensure that we address this as soon as possible to avoid any disruptions. Could you please let me know a convenient time when we can plan the updates for the remaining components? I will ensure a thorough review this time to prevent any further issues.

Thank you for your understanding, and I appreciate your support in scheduling this follow-up.
