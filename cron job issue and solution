**Subject:** Discussion on Job Execution and Cache Loading Post Redis Migration  

Dear Team,  

I’d like to provide an update regarding the current state of job execution in our production environment, specifically after the Redis migration, and propose some potential solutions for improvement.  

### **Current State:**  
1. **Existing Ehcache Configuration:**
   - We have two jobs configured:
     - A **cron job** that runs at **1 AM daily**.
     - A job that runs **5 minutes after application deployment** and then repeats at the same time daily (with a 24-hour interval).  
   - In production, with **3 instances per service**, the job currently executes multiple times:
     - **3 instances x 2 frequencies** = **6 executions per day per service.**

2. **Post Redis Migration Observations:**
   - Efforts were made to ensure jobs run **only once per instance**.  
   - Specifically:
     - The job scheduled **5 minutes after deployment** was configured to run on a single instance and not repeat.  
     - However, despite setting the largest possible fixed delay, the job still ran on multiple instances after deployment.  
     - Attempts to execute it within the `@PostConstruct` method also led to repeated executions due to the **bean initialization** occurring multiple times across instances.  
   - The **1 AM cron job** is functioning correctly, executing exactly once on a single instance daily.  
   - For performance considerations, we have limited jobs to the 1 AM schedule. However, following deployment, any endpoint hits trigger database calls directly instead of utilizing the Redis cache.

### **Challenges:**
- **Ensuring the job runs only once after deployment.**
- **Avoiding multiple executions of the same job across instances.**

### **Proposed Solutions:**
1. **Enhance Deployment-Time Job Execution:**
   - Modify the job configuration to ensure it runs **once after deployment** and continues with the **1 AM daily cron schedule.**  
   - This would likely require additional development effort (e.g., creating a user story for proper implementation).  

2. **Manual Cache Loading Options:**
   - Expose a **REST endpoint** to trigger cache loading manually in an **asynchronous manner.**  
   - Alternatively, create an **Autosys job** to execute cache loading asynchronously.  
     - **Note:** Autosys onboarding will require time for setup:
       - Creating JIL files.
       - Raising a CR for adding these jobs to production and BCP.  

3. **Open to Suggestions:**
   - If there are other feasible solutions, I am open to exploring them further.  

### **Next Steps:**
Please review the above points and share your thoughts or suggestions. Let’s discuss and finalize the best approach to ensure optimal performance and reliability in job execution.  

Looking forward to your inputs.  

Best regards,
