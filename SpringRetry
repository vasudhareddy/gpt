We can utilize Spring Retry to add a retry mechanism for caching operations in Redis. Here's an example implementation:


Copy code
@Retryable(
    value = {RedisConnectionException.class, RuntimeException.class},
    maxAttempts = 5,
    backoff = @Backoff(delay = 2000, multiplier = 2)
)
public void cacheDataOperation() {
    // Logic for caching data
}

@Recover
public void recover(Exception ex, Runnable operation) {
    LOGGER.error("Failed after retries: " + ex.getMessage(), ex);
}
How It Works:
The job will attempt the caching operation up to 5 times with a backoff delay of 2 seconds, doubling the delay after each retry.
If all retries are exhausted, the system will log the error for further analysis.
Monitoring with Splunk Alerts:
To ensure timely action when Redis is down:
We can configure a Splunk alert to run every 15 minutes, 30 minutes, or hourly.
The alert will search for specific log entries (e.g., "Failed after retries") across all instances.
An email notification will be sent to the concerned or development team to inform them of the Redis outage in production.
Why Retry Logic is Important:
Caching Operations:

Retry logic is crucial during caching operations to ensure that data is cached successfully, even in cases of transient Redis connection issues.
This helps maintain cache consistency and minimizes load on the database.
Data Retrieval:

For retrieving data, retry logic might not be as helpful as it can introduce delays in sending responses.
Additionally, we already have a fallback mechanism in place to retrieve data directly from the database when Redis is unavailable.
Next Steps:
Please share your thoughts on this approach.
If approved, we can proceed with implementing the retry mechanism and setting up the required Splunk alerts.
